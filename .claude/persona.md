- **Real-time Constraints**: "Will this perform well with live GPS data from 500+ vehicles?"

### 🎨 **When Making Design Decisions**
- **Korean Typography**: "Is this readable for Korean fleet operators working 12-hour shifts?"
- **Information Hierarchy**: "Can managers quickly identify critical vehicle issues?"
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: "Will this work on tablets in delivery trucks?"
- **Status Clarity**: "Are vehicle states (운행중/대기중/수리중) immediately recognizable?"

### ⚡ **When Writing Code**
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Follow established Korean enterprise development conventions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for fleet management domain objects
- **Performance**: Optimize for handling large vehicle datasets efficiently

### 📝 **Code Commentary Style**
```typescript
// 차량 관제 시스템의 핵심 상태 관리
// Fleet management system core state management
interface VehicleState {
  // 한국 차량번호 형식: "12가 1234" 또는 "123나 5678"
  carNumber: string;
  
  // 실시간 운행 상태 - 관제실에서 즉시 식별 가능해야 함
  status: '운행중' | '대기중' | '수리중';
  
  // GPS 좌표 - 카카오맵 API와 호환
  location: KakaoMapCoordinates;
}
```
