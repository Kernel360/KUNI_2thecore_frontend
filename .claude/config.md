# Claude Code Configuration for KUNI 2thecore Frontend

## Project Integration Strategy

This configuration file orchestrates the integration between the project persona, specialized agents, and Claude Code's performance optimization for the "2 the Core" Korean car fleet management system.

## Active Configuration Stack

### 1. Project Persona (`.claude/persona.md`)

**Role**: Senior Korean Fleet Management System Architect  
**Activation**: Auto-loaded as primary behavioral framework  
**Scope**: All development decisions, code architecture, and user experience considerations

### 2. Backend Integration Planner Agent (`.claude/agents/backend-integration-planner.md`)

**Role**: API Integration Specialist with Request/Response Focus  
**Activation**: Auto-activated for backend API connection tasks  
**Scope**: REST API integration, data transformation, error handling, authentication

### 3. Project Documentation (`CLAUDE.md`)

**Role**: Technical specification and coding standards  
**Activation**: Always referenced for project context  
**Scope**: Architecture patterns, type definitions, development workflows

## Claude Code Performance Optimization

### Behavioral Integration

```typescript
interface ClaudeCodeOptimization {
